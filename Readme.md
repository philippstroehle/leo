==================

This utility lets the user search for words on leo.org, a popular tranlation website and forum. The specified search term (in German) is looked up and the corresponding result is returned via google's Chrome browser.

To run this script conveniently from the command line, place it on your $PATH.

In the case of Ubuntu Linux 13.10, I place this tool in /usr/local/bin/.
